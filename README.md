#d2b-placeholder-first
This is a "parallax" scrolling page used as a placeholder for a horse tack ecommerce site that I'm going to start with my fianc√©e. it uses [skrollr](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr) alongside a modified version of [skrollr-stylesheets](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr-stylesheets) for the scrolling effects. The modification of skrollr-stylesheets is just to convert it from being an immediate function to a callable function that I can trigger after modifications to the dom are ready. I needed this, because I'm using [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11978995/how-to-change-color-of-svg-image-using-css-jquery-svg-image-replacement) tecnique by Drew Baker on [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) to convert img tags with svg images to inline svg so I can use css to control fill color.
